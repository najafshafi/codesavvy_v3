      "content": "Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cyber security measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. Essential strategies in cyber security involve using a combination of tools, techniques, and processes designed to safeguard computer networks, devices, programs, and data from unauthorized access or damage. Cyber security spans multiple domains, including application security, information security, network security, disaster recovery, and end-user education. Each domain requires robust protocols and constant vigilance to counteract and mitigate the risks posed by cyber threats.",
